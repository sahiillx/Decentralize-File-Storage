#Decentralize-File-Storage
Welcome to our GitHub repository! This project leverages the power of decentralization, using Solidity for smart contracts, IPFS for secure and distributed file storage, and React for a user-friendly interface. With this combination, we're creating a robust and secure file storage solution tailored to blockchain applications. Say goodbye to centralized data control and hello to a transparent, secure, and decentralized approach to managing digital files. Explore our codebase and join us in revolutionizing the future of data storage in blockchain projects.
